# About Hiddify Manager Bot

Hello , and welcome to the [Hiddify Manager](https://github.com/hiddify/Hiddify-Manager) Bot GitHub page. I'm currently developing a bot for managing the Hiddify panel, and I'd be delighted if you could assist me in testing and refining the bot through trial and error. Additionally, if you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them. Thank you!
